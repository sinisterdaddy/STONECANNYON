### Sample Interaction Flow:
1. **User Inquiry:**
   - User: "I need a plumber."
   - BOT: "Feel free to describe the problem in as much detail as you'd like or even send us a photo."
   - User: Describes or sends a photo.
2. **Detailed Response:**
   - BOT: "Oh no. Your toilet is overflowing. Let's get someone out there asap. Please send us your address. In the meantime, make sure to turn the water valve off. It looks like this [insert photo]. Turn it counterclockwise or right to left until it tightens."
   - User: "123 Main, LA, CA 90064."
3. **Additional Information:**
   - BOT: "It looks like this is a two-story home (Zillow scrub). Is the toilet located on the first or second floor? What kind of toilet? How old is it?"
   - User: "It is on the second floor."
   - BOT: "Have you checked downstairs to make sure it isn't leaking?"
   - User: "It is leaking down the wall on the first floor."
   - BOT: "Water leaking behind a wall from a toilet can create an ideal environment for mold to grow. Mold can also grow inside walls or under flooring from water leaks. Mold colonies can appear as black, green, or brown patches and can spread quickly. Mold can be detrimental to health and difficult to remove. Black mold, which is common in bathrooms, can cause chronic coughing, wheezing, breathing issues, sneezing, watery eyes, sore throats, chronic fatigue, and rashes. In more serious cases, it may be a primary factor in contracting pneumonia. Mold also produces toxic gases and poisonous mycotoxins. Would you like us to get ServPro out there too to eliminate any mold risk?"
